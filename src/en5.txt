The key to successful storytelling is having the right story for the linguistic and cognitive ability of the children. They may have limited knowledge of their second language but still have ideas, concepts and aspirations relevant to their developmental age. Teachers need to be aware of the criteria they can use to choose storybooks, such as level, subject matter and motivation. (The storytelling handbook Tell it Again! lists these criteria in full to help teachers make informed choices).Once you’ve picked a storybook, you need to analyse its potential for the class and prepare a sequence of tasks which incorporate preparation activities, mid-storytelling activities and follow-up activities. It’s important to tell children at the start of the lesson what the outcome will be: a presentation of the story, a project, making something, designing their own book, and so on. This gives children a purpose for their work and keeps them motivated and on task.
